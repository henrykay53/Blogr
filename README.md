### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

 I started the project using mobile-first workflow, then on to desktop and lastly tablets.
 I completed the html for both the mobile and desktop view before moving on to css for styling,
 after that it was on to using css to style for tablets and then javascript for the hamburger and
 overlay interaction.

 There were lots of break as I was constanly learning to solve various roadblocks I encountered.

### Built with

This project was built using:

    * HTML 5
    * CSS 3
    * JAVASCRIPT 
    * Flexbox
    * Mobile-first workflow
    * CSS custom properties

### What I learned

  I learnt how to manipulate the DOM, I also leart how to create and style a hamburger menu with all of its content.
  During the period I worked on this project I familiarized myself with Javascript concepts I have read about.
  My CSS was quite challenging but it afforded me the opportunity to learn about background images and how to properly position them.


### Continued development
  
 I would love to start developing my pages using SASS,
 continue refining my HTML and also get comfortable using plain JavaScript before moving on to a framework.
